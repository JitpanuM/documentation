# Raw binary values

VILLASnode supports sending samples formatted as raw binary data.

Signal values are encoded according to their configured data-type in either integer or IEEE-754 floating point values.

## Implementation

The source code of the format-type is available here:
https://github.com/VILLASframework/node/blob/master/lib/formats/raw.cpp

## Configuration {#config}

import ApiSchema from '@theme/ApiSchema';

<ApiSchema id="node" example pointer="#/components/schemas/raw" />

## Example Configuration {#example}

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/formats/raw.conf" title="node/etc/examples/formats/raw.conf"
nodes = {
	node = {
		type = "file"
		uri = "/dev/null"

		format = {
			type = "raw"

			bits = 32
			endianess = "little"
			fake = false
		}
	}
}
```

## Notes

- Floating-point encoding is only supported for width larger or equal to 32 bit.
- The `raw` format-type does not support vectors. Only a single sample can be encoded per payload as there is no way to identify sample boundaries in the raw format.
- Complex sample values are supported and are encoded by real and imaginary parts with half of the precision as noted in the "Floating-point Precision" column above. E.g. in 64 bit mode real and imaginary components are encoded as two single-precision values encoded right after each other.
- Support for 128-bit wide values depends on you compiler support.
