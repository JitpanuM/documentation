# villas signal

The `villas signal` command is a signal generator which writes samples to `stdout`.
This command can be combined with the [`villas pipe` command](villas-pipe.md) to build more complex pipelines.
Please note that we recommand to use the [`villas node` daemon](villas-node.md) for more production setups as it is more performant and allows for an easier configuration via [paths](../config/paths.md) .
