# ZeroMQ

The `zeromq` node-type exchanges messages via the [ZMTP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23/ZMTP/) protocol.
It is similar to the [`nanomsg`](nanomsg.md) node-type.

> ZeroMQ (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ZeroMQ is from iMatix and is LGPLv3 open source.

The `zeromq` node-type implements the [publish/subscribe and radio/dish protocols](http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-socket).

## Prerequisites

This node-type requires [libzmq](http://zeromq.org) (>= 2.2.0).

## Implementation

The source code of the node-type is available here:
https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/villas/node/blob/master/lib/nodes/zeromq.cpp

## Configuration {#config}

### format (string)

The payload format which is used to encode and decode exchanged messages.

### filter (string: "pubsub" | "radiodish")

### publish (string: uri)

### subscribe (string / array of strings: uri)

### ipv6 (bool) = false

### CurveZMQ cryptography

**Note:** This feature is currently broken.

You can use the [`villas zmq-keygen`](../usage/villas-zmq-keygen.md) command to create a new keypair for the following configuration options:

#### curve.enabled (bool) = true

Whether or not the encryption is enabled.

#### curve.public_key (string: Z85 encoded)

The public key of the server.

#### curve.private_key (string: Z85 encoded)

The private key of the server.

## Example

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/nodes/zeromq.conf" title="node/etc/examples/nodes/zeromq.conf"
nodes = {
	zeromq_node = {
		type = "zeromq"

		pattern = "pubsub"			# The ZeroMQ pattern. One of pubsub, radiodish
		ipv6 = false				# Enable IPv6 support

		curve = {				# Z85 encoded Curve25519 keys
			enabled = false,
			public_key = "Veg+Q.V-c&1k>yVh663gQ^7fL($y47gybE-nZP1L"
			secret_key = "HPY.+mFuB[jGs@(zZr6$IZ1H1dZ7Ji*j>oi@O?Pc"
		}

		in = {
			subscribe = "tcp://*:1234"	# The subscribe endpoint.
							# See http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-bind for details.
			filter = "ab184"		# A filter which is prefix matched for each received msg
		}
		out = {
			publish = [			# The publish endpoints.
				"tcp://localhost:1235",	# See http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-connect for details.
				"tcp://localhost:12444"
			]

			filter = "ab184"		# A prefix which is pre-pended to each message.
		}
	}
}
```
