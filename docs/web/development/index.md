# Development {#web-development}

Before starting working on the VILLASweb code-base, we strongly recommend to familiarize yourself with VILLASweb's [data-model](../structure.md).

In order to get started with VILLASweb and the whole VILLASframework in general, you might also want to check our our [Helm chart](../../installation.md).

We recommend to setup the VILLASweb backend before you start working on the frontend:

- [Frontend](frontend.md)
- [Backend](backend.md)
