# Node-types {#node-types}

Every server needs clients which act as sinks / sources for simulation data. In case of VILLASnode these clients are called _nodes_.
Every node is an instance of a node-type. VILLASnode currently supports the following node-types:

- @subpage fpga-type
- @subpage opal
- @subpage file
- @subpage socket
- @subpage websocket
- @subpage ngsi
- @subpage labview
