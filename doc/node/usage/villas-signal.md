# villas signal {#node-usage-signal}

The `villas signal` command is a signal generator which writes samples to `stdout`.
This command can be combined with the @ref node-usage-pipe command to build more complex pipelines.
Please note that we recommand to use the @ref node-usage-node daemon for more production setups as it is more performant and allows for an easier configuration via @ref node-config-paths .
