- up to date live image for VILLASnode

Markus M.:
- scripts for automated testing (CI tests)

Marija:
- List with description and config files for test cases of VILLAS framework
- Execution and logging of manual tests with simulators
- Provide demo simulation examples (not only communication clients) for OPAL and RTDS with VILLAS framework (i.e. including VILLASnode and VILLASweb visualisation )
